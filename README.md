# RockPaperScissors
A best-of-three game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer! The user is prompted to choose rock, paper or scissors, and the computer randomly chooses as well. The results are then compared and printed, and the game number and winner is recorded. At the end of the three games, the final winner is printed to the screen.
